### Team Contract:
*I will complete all work assigned to me on time, and to the best of my ability.*
*I will attend every team meeting, actively participate, give thoughtful responses, and give
criticism while also respecting my team members' ideas.*
*If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my team for help.*
*The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members, EVERYBODY will write code.*
*Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team meeting, I will notify my team
immediately.*
*If I do not the proper amount of work assigned, I will accept the consequences that my team will bring
upon me*

### Consequences of not abiding to the team contract:
1. *Potential catch up plan if work has not been completed: The work will be distributed to the 
other team members evenly to ensure we have enough time and manpower to complete work that was 
not completed*
2. *If the issue consists, the other team members may have a sit down with the member not doing their
assigned tasks and discuss why nothing is being done*
3. *IF it becomes a huge issue, instructors will be notified of your work not being completed if a huge deadline
has been reached*

### Team coding plan:
The work that will be done will be completed in pairs of 2, in order to combine the typing of code
and the other tasks that are involved in the typing of code, like searching syntax and discussing
design issues.
The coding pairs are:
Jimmy - Fred (This pair will use mostly Fred's laptop because Jimmy's computer is awful)
Zuhab - Alex (This pair will split work between computers)
