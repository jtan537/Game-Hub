# Meeting Wednesday, November 21st.

Discussed for 20 minutes the plan to complete the final projects, including assigning roles to the 
pairs. 

We decided to assign the final tasks as such:

Minesweeper game and backend logic - Jimmy, Fred. 
    - We completed this task the same day. Although a fair bit challenging, the game was finished
      in terms of the backend logic today.
Minesweeper frontend UI - Alex, Zuhab.
    - Create the activity and listeners, that call the logic from Jimmy and Fred's code.
    - Continued to communicate the functionality of the backend to the pair to make sure
      that the game functioned and looked nice.
2048 Clone(PowersPlus) - A game where the bases (like how in 2048 the game is in base 2, we have
multiple bases) - Alex, Zuhab.
    - Will complete throughout the week, including the front end UI

Since the Jimmy, Fred pair completed the game sooner, we decided to get a headstart on the unit tests
(in terms of understanding how to create them).

Discussed some plausible design issues, such as duplicate code with Paul and created a plan to reduce 
the occurence of the code smells. Goal is to reduce code smells in our design(particularly in
Jimmy, Fred pairs minesweeper and leaderboard code, and game activity classes.)

Next meeting on Friday, November 23rd.
